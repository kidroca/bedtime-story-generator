There was Krell, a reptilian engineer; Mira, a psychic navigator; Rennick, a grizzled human pilot; and Yllarii, an alien doctor with healing abilities.\n\nAs they embarked on their journey to uncover ancient artifacts scattered across distant planets – relics rumored to hold immense power – Zara couldn't help but feel that she was about to embark on something much larger than herself.",
