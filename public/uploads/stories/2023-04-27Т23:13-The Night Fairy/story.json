        "content": "Once upon a time, in a small town far away, there lived a fairy named Tilly. She was sassy and adventurous but also kindhearted. One night, as the children were tucked in bed sound asleep, Tilly flew into their room through an open window. She quietly landed on the windowsill and looked around to make sure no one was watching. Satisfied that she had gone unnoticed, she began to wave her wand and soon a box appeared.",
